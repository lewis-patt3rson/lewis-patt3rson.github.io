									<h2>What was our task?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Myself and two other students were tasked with joining MIS for three weeks to assist them in helping a department of the North West Regional College, as MIS are the team who handle the college's software issues and development.</p>
								<p>We were tasked to create a system to allow for electronic attendance registering for students in UCAS workshops, which would allow the careers department to understand if there was a correlation between student attendance at UCAS workshops compared to applications to universities, in an attempt to value the worth and effectiveness of the workshops.</p>
								<header class="major">
									<h2>How did we do it?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>We first decided to design a database design from a requirements gathering meeting, from which we then delegated work accordingly. My group members were tasked with creating a record for safeguarding students and one for viewing ucas reports, whilst I worked on the creation of the workshop system as well as the report generating and viewing for the system, more details are shown below with screenshots.</p>
								<p>During our third week of the placement the UK government initiated a lockdown due to the coronavirus, meaning we had to compelte the system from home with online communication with the client and MIS to ensure we met requirements for both.</p>

											<h3>Creating a workshop</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Workshop admins would choose from the list of comboboxes to set which workshop they were taking, at what campus with their name as the co-ordinator. They can then add the course that is taking this workshop, or if they want they can search for the course as shwon in the course finder.</p>
										<p>The course finder allows co-ordinators to search for classes by names filtered by what they have already typed and updated each time text in the search bar is updated, or add a course if it is not already accounted for in the system as we had limited access to the database due to COVID-19 and had to implement an Excel set to SQL.</p>
										<P>Finally, once the workshop's details are established, the student's names and emails can be recorded to the system.</P>

											<h3>Viewing Details</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Admins could also use the system to view workshops, by choosing a workshop from the list (which can be filtered). Once a workshop is selected, the students can be viewed in a new window as shown inside the list of workshops.</p>
										<p>There is also the addition of date filters for start and end dates to search within for workshops, to add another method of filtering for the careers academy.</p>
										<P>This data could then be exported to Excel using the button provided, allowing for reports to be made.</P>
